Simple Calculator - Practice Project (Version 1)

- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Icon-based buttons for an intuitive interface
- A "Switch to Dark Mode" button for toggling the theme
- An "Information" button to display details about the application
- A message dialog that appears when an incorrect input is entered
